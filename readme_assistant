> *"Just as the mythological god of the forge crafted tools for the gods, Hephaestus Assistant is a secure, air-gapped AI coding agent deployed on our local H100 GPU. It acts as a powerful pair-programmer for our Data Science team, accelerating the creation of complex NLP and data extraction pipelines, while ensuring 100% of our banking data and intellectual property remains strictly on-premises."*

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Hephaestus Assistant** is an initiative to deploy a generative AI infrastructure dedicated to coding, operating in a **strictly air-gapped environment** within Domino Data Lab.

This project addresses two critical business needs:
* **Absolute Banking Security:** Providing Copilot/ChatGPT-level capabilities without exposing a single line of code, client data, or query to the public internet.
* **Data Science Productivity:** Drastically accelerating the development of unstructured data processing pipelines (NLP, Speech-to-Text, OCR) with an autonomous agent capable of understanding complex contexts, debugging, and refactoring Python/SQL code.

## 🏗️ Target Architecture

To guarantee performance without compromising security or user experience, we utilize a decoupled hardware architecture hosted within Domino:

| Component | Role | Allocated Hardware | Local Quantized AI Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The "Brain" (Agent)** | Complex reasoning, Chat, Pipeline creation, Autonomous debugging. | **Primary GPU (NVIDIA H100 80GB)** | `cyankiwi/Kimi-Dev-72B-AWQ-4bit` |
| **The "Reflex" (Autocomplete)** | Instant code completion (Tab) with ultra-low latency (<300ms). | **Secondary GPU (e.g., L4 24GB)** | `Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base` |
| **Inference Engine** | High-performance, OpenAI-compatible API server. | N/A | **vLLM** (x2 instances) |
| **User Interface** | Data Scientists' IDE. | Local Workstations | **VS Code** + Continue & Roo Code |

**Why this architecture?**
* **Security (Safetensors):** The selected models are audited and use the `.safetensors` format, guaranteeing that no malicious code can be executed during weight loading (no `trust_remote_code` required).
* **Workload Isolation:** Using two distinct GPUs ensures that the heavy reasoning tasks of the Agent do not bottleneck the instant autocomplete features for the rest of the team.
* **VRAM Optimization:** The **4-bit AWQ** quantization format fits a massive 72-billion parameter model onto the H100 while preserving **~40GB of working memory (KV Cache)** to analyze large client documents and NLP scripts.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

To connect your VS Code to Hephaestus Assistant in Domino:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install the **Continue** extension (for fast chat and autocomplete) and **Roo Code / Cline** (for autonomous agent tasks) from the internal VS Code marketplace.
2.  **Configuration:** Open the `config.json` file in the Continue extension and use the following configuration to point to our local vLLM servers:
